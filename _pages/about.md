<h3>PhD Student at LISN, Université Paris-Saclay and LORIA (France)</h3>

I started my first year of PhD in October 2023. I'm working on the evaluation of stereotypical biases in autoregressive language models.

I have a master's degree in Linguistics and Computer Science and a bachelor's degree in Linguistics and NLP, both from Sorbonne-Université. 

<h3>Interests</h3>

I'm especially interested in ethics, NLP4NLP, linguistic diversity, and sociolinguistics. 

<!--
I've already worked on the application of the #BenderRule in ACL, LREC and TALN articles and co-authored 2 articles regarding that study. In September 2022, I defended my M1 thesis on claims in NLP articles. I'm currently working on my M2 thesis on biases in Language Models.
