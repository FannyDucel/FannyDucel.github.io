<h3>M2 Student in NLP at Sorbonne-Université, Paris, France</h3>

I obtained a bachelor's degree in Linguistics and NLP ("Sciences du Langage spécialité Informatique") at Sorbonne-Université in 2021. 

I started my second year of master's degree in Linguistics & Computer science ("Langue & informatique") at Sorbonne-Université in Paris in September 2022. 

I'd like to start a PhD in NLP after my master's degree.

<h3>Interests</h3>

I'm especially interested in ethics, NLP4NLP, linguistic diversity, sociolinguistics. 

I've already worked on the application of the #BenderRule in ACL, LREC and TALN articles and co-authored 2 articles regarding that study. In September 2022, I defended my M1 thesis on claims in NLP articles. I'm currently working on my M2 thesis on biases in Language Models.
